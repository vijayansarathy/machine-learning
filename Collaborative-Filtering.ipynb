Movies are in rows, users in columns. Each user has a parameter vector $w^{user}$ and bias. Each movie has a feature vector $x^{movie}$. These vectors are simultaneously learned by using the existing user/movie ratings as training data. One training example is shown above: $\\mathbf{w}^{(1)} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}^{(1)} + b^{(1)} = 4$. It is worth noting that the feature vector $x^{movie}$ must satisfy all the users while the user vector $w^{user}$ must satisfy all the movies.
